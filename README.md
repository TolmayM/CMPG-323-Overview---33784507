<h2> Branching Strategy </h2>

In this assignment I will use two branches: a main branch and a secondary branch. I will be adding changes to the secondary branch and when Im done I will merge this branch with my main branch to finalise my coding.

<h2> .gitignore </h2>
.gitignore will be used to specify which files should be private so that no one else can access the files except me.

<h2> Storage of Credentials and Sensitive
Information </h2>

If there are any sensitive information that I wouldnt like to share I will make use of the .gitignore function to specify the files with the information that I would like to hide.
